## Technical Architecture

### Programming Language

After careful consideration, we've selected C# as our primary development language with the following approach:

- **Pure C# Implementation**: Using unsafe C# blocks for performance-critical sections
- **Key Benefits**:
  - 30-50% faster development compared to C++
  - Modern language features (LINQ, async/await, pattern matching)
  - Strong tooling with Visual Studio
  - Reduced complexity in memory management
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Approximately 10-15% performance overhead compared to optimized C++
  - Performance-critical systems will use unsafe C# blocks for direct memory manipulation
  - Careful garbage collection management to prevent frame stutters

### Framework Selection

- **Primary Framework**: MonoGame with MonoGame.Extended
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - FNA: More lightweight than MonoGame
  - Stride: More modern rendering pipeline but steeper learning curve

### Core Technical Systems

1. **Rendering Pipeline**
   - 3D rendering with deferred shading
   - Dynamic lighting system crucial for stealth mechanics
   - First-person camera implementation

2. **Entity Component System**
   - Component-based architecture for game objects
   - System processing of entity collections
   - Event-based communication between systems

3. **Physics System**
   - Collision detection and response
   - Raycasting for interaction and visibility testing
   - Options include BEPUphysics, Jitter Physics, or custom implementation

4. **Input System**
   - Mapping logical actions to physical inputs
   - Contextual control schemes
   - First-person controller implementation

5. **Audio System**
   - Positional audio for immersion
   - Sound propagation for AI awareness

6. **Performance-Critical Areas** (for unsafe C# blocks)
   - Spatial partitioning (octrees, grid systems)
   - Physics collision detection
   - Visibility/stealth detection
   - Audio propagation for AI awareness
   - Complex AI decision-making

## Initial Development Focus

To maximize productivity as a solo developer, we'll follow this approach:

1. **Prototype core mechanics first**
   - Build small test environments that prove gameplay concepts
   - Focus on player movement, interaction, and basic AI

2. **Vertical slice approach**
   - Create a small but complete section demonstrating core systems
   - Test system interactions in a controlled environment

3. **Iterative development cycles**
   - Implement basic versions first, then improve incrementally
   - Regular testing throughout development

4. **Performance-based optimization**
   - Only optimize after profiling reveals bottlenecks
   - Use unsafe C# blocks strategically
